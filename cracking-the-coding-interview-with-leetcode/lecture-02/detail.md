# Python OOP, Mutable vs Immutable and Two Pointer Technique

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of __object__  and __class__. A class can be thought of as a _blueprint_ for objects which can contain data and code: data as attributes or properties , and code in form of methods. Object-oriented programming has some advantages over other design patterns. Many of the most widely used programming languages _(such as C++, Java, Python, etc.)_ are multi-paradigm and they support object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree.

### Objects and classes
Languages that support object-oriented programming (OOP) typically use inheritance for code reuse and extensibility in the form of either classes or prototypes. Those that use classes support two main concepts:

- Classes : the definitions for the data format and available procedures for a given type or class of object; may also contain data and procedures (known as class methods) themselves, i.e. classes contain the data members and member functions
- Objects : instances of classes
